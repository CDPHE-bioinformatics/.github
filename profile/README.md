# CDPHE GSP Bioinformatics

This GitHub organization is for the Bioinformatics Unit of the Genomics Surveillance Program (GSP) within the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).

## üëã Welcome

GSP leverages the power of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze the genetic makeup of pathogens, providing valuable insights into:

- Disease outbreaks: Identifying the source and spread of outbreaks, enabling rapid response and containment.
- Sentinel surveillance: Capturing the genetic changes that drive pathogen evolution to inform vaccine development and other preventative measures. 
- Wastewater surveillance: Measuring community-level disease prevalence, enabling early detection and intervention.

## üìë Contents
